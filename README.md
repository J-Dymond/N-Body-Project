# N-Body-Project
PHY480 N-Body project

This project aims to simulate the solar system accurately using the N-Body approach. It includes a functional 4th-order predictor-corrector algorithm implemented in Fortran.

Please note that this project lacks proper documentation due to being created during a learning phase of GitHub usage. However, 

The primary goal of this project is to replicate the Milankovitch cycles, which are observed in geological records. These cycles are caused by perturbations in orbital distance and interactions with Venus. Relevant figures can be found in the "FiguresSecond" folder. Precise simulation is necessary to reproduce these cycles accurately.

The project also includes an energy loss diagram that depicts the overall energy lost by the predictor-corrector algorithm. After simulating for 700,000 years, the algorithm experienced a negligible energy loss of 10 millionths of a percent. Unfortunately, the simulation couldn't be extended due to hardware limitations.
